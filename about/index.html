<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h4>My artistic practice is founded on the belief that large-scale change can be brought about by what begins as small-scale communication within individual communities. Sharing openly, seeing each other, hearing what we collectively need -- and then making tangible moves towards achieving these conditions -- this is what legitimate political power looks like to me.
    <br>
    <br>
    To this end, I aspire to create work that helps communities both A) to re-enforce the fact that a better world is attainable and B) to articulate in each situation what the material conditions are that would need to change for this “better” to be achieved.
    <br>
    <br>
    I work in a variety of mediums, styles, formats, and am interested in creative solutions that fit form to content rather than the other way around. As this exploration and innovation is central to my practice, so is collaboration. My goals are to listen more than I talk, to experiment, and to find ways forward together.
